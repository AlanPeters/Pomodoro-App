# Pomodoro-App

This app is still in its early stages. 

## Goals
* Provide a real-time synchronization of the timer accross mulitple devices
    - I want to be able to leave my desk then stop the timer I accidentally left running. 
* Track my list of To-do's
* Add a planning interface. 
    - I follow a general rule for how many pomodoro's I can accomplish in a day. I would like to take this in to consideration as I plan out my work
